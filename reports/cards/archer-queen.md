## Notes
- **Name Mapping**: Card is identified as "ArcherQueen" in gamedata.json
- **Assumption**: Card would spawn as basic troop using existing `Troop` class
- **Critical Gap**: No champion/ability framework exists in the codebase
- **Data Available**: All necessary stats and ability data exist in gamedata.json but cannot be utilized
- **Implementation Status**: Card would function as a basic ranged troop without its signature champion ability
