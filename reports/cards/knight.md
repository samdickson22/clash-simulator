# Knight Card Implementation Audit

## Card Info
- **Card**: Knight
- **Elixir**: 3
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Type**: Kingdom

## Implemented
- Basic troop movement and pathfinding (entities.py:240-690)
- Melee attack system with hit detection (entities.py:296-308)
- Ground-only targeting (attacksGround: true)
- Standard collision detection and hitbox system
- HP and damage scaling
- Sight range implementation for target acquisition
- Bridge navigation and river crossing logic

## Missing
Based on gamedata.json analysis, the Knight has no special mechanics or gimmicks:
- No charge/dash mechanics
- No projectiles or ranged attacks
- No area damage
- No death spawn/effects
- No shield or defensive abilities
- No healing or lifesteal
- No aura effects
- No pull/tether mechanics
- No rage/slow effects
- No spawning abilities
- No tower-specific interactions
- No immunity rules
- No evolution mechanics (excluded as requested)

## Notes
- Knight is a basic melee troop with no special abilities
- All core mechanics (movement, attacking, targeting) are implemented in the base Troop class
- Name mapping: "Knight" in gamedata.json maps directly to Knight entity
- Implementation relies on standard troop behavior in entities.py:240-690
- No special code needed - Knight uses default Troop functionality
