- All stats match gamedata.json: 532 HP, 295 damage, 90 speed, 0.8 range, 1.6s hit speed
- The card has no unique gimmicks or special abilities according to gamedata.json
- Implementation relies entirely on the generic `Troop` class in `src/clasher/entities.py`
- Name mapping: "MiniPekka" in code vs "Mini P.E.K.K.A" display name
- The Super Mini P.E.K.K.A evolution was excluded from this audit as requested
