# Mighty Miner Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Mighty Miner
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Champion
- **Type**: Ground troop with special ability

## Implemented

### Basic Troop Mechanics
- ✅ **Ground troop movement** (src/clasher/entities.py:240-690) - Troop class handles basic movement, targeting, and combat
- ✅ **Ground targeting only** (gamedata.json: `tidTarget": "TID_TARGETS_GROUND"`) - Can only attack ground units and buildings
- ✅ **Melee attacks** (gamedata.json: `range": 1600`) - Short range indicates melee combat
- ✅ **Standard combat stats** (gamedata.json: `hitpoints": 879, "damage": 16, "hitSpeed": 400`) - Basic HP, damage, and attack speed implemented

## Missing

### Champion Ability System
- ❌ **Lane Switch Ability** (gamedata.json: `abilityData": {"name": "MightyMinerLaneSwitch"`) - No champion ability system exists in codebase
- ❌ **Ability Cost** (gamedata.json: `manaCost": 1`) - 1 elixir cost for ability activation not implemented
- ❌ **Ability Cooldown** (gamedata.json: `cooldown": 13000`) - 13 second cooldown not implemented
- ❌ **Bomb Spawn on Ability** (gamedata.json: `activationSpawnCharacterData": {"name": "MightyMinerBomb"`) - No mechanism to spawn entities via abilities

### Spawn Entity System
- ❌ **MightyMinerBomb Entity** (gamedata.json: `"deathDamage": 130`) - Bomb entity with area damage on death not implemented
- ❌ **Death Damage Mechanics** - No system for entities to deal damage on death
- ❌ **Air & Ground Targeting for Spawned Entities** (gamedata.json: `"tidTarget": "TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND"`) - Bomb should hit both air and ground

### Champion Card Type
- ❌ **Champion Classification** (gamedata.json: `"rarity": "Champion"`) - No special handling for champion cards
- ❌ **Champion UI/Ability Interface** - No visual or input system for champion abilities

## Notes

### Data Mapping
- Card name in gamedata.json: `"name": "MightyMiner"`
- English display name: `"englishName": "Mighty Miner"`
- Internal ID: `26000065`

### Ability Mechanics from gamedata.json
The Mighty Miner's ability should:
1. Cost 1 additional elixir to activate
2. Have a 13-second cooldown
3. Spawn a "MightyMinerBomb" entity that deals 130 death damage in an area
4. The bomb should target both air and ground units

### Implementation Gaps
The codebase currently lacks:
1. Any champion/ability system architecture
2. Mechanisms for spawned entities from troop abilities
3. Death damage mechanics for entities
4. UI/input handling for champion abilities

### Status
**Overall Implementation: ~25% complete**
- Basic troop functionality exists
- No champion-specific features implemented
- Ability system entirely missing
