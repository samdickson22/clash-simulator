# Goblinstein Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Name**: Goblinstein
- **Elixir**: 5
- **Category**: Troop (Champion)
- **Rarity**: Champion
- **Type**: Dual-component troop

## Implemented
- Basic troop spawning (battle.py:166)
- Movement and pathfinding (entities.py:251)
- Target acquisition and attack logic (entities.py:159)
- Status effects (stun, slow) handling (entities.py:108)
- Hitbox-based collision detection (entities.py:813)
- Projectile creation and movement (entities.py:768)
- Area damage/splash damage mechanics (entities.py:803)
- Building targeting logic (entities.py:169)

## Missing
### Core Mechanics
- **Dual unit spawning**: Card spawns two separate units (Doctor + Monster) - not implemented
- **Doctor component**: Ranged attacker with stun projectiles - not implemented
- **Monster component**: Melee unit that only targets buildings - not implemented
- **Lightning Link ability**: 2-elixir area damage ability - not implemented
- **Ability activation system**: No framework for champion abilities - not implemented

### Specific Features
- **Stun projectile effect**: Doctor's projectile applies 0.5s stun (gamedata.json:6764-6770) - missing
- **Building-only targeting**: Monster component exclusively targets buildings (gamedata.json:6731) - missing
- **Area damage aura**: Lightning Link ability area damage (gamedata.json:6777-6788) - missing
- **Champion classification**: No special handling for champion cards - missing

### Data Integration
- **Ability data integration**: gamedata.json contains abilityData but unused (gamedata.json:6772-6788) - missing
- **Projectile buff system**: Doctor's stun buff exists in data but not implemented (gamedata.json:6762-6770) - missing
- **Second character spawning**: summonCharacterSecondData exists but unused (gamedata.json:6734-6742) - missing

## Notes
- The card exists in gamedata.json with complete mechanical definitions
- Basic troop framework exists but lacks champion-specific features
- No ability activation system implemented in the codebase
- Split targeting (Doctor vs units, Monster vs buildings) not supported
- Missing aura/area effect system for the Lightning Link ability
- Projectile buff system exists for stun effect but not integrated
- Game has no concept of "Champion" card classification beyond rarity

### Name Mapping
- Card name: "Goblinstein" (gamedata.json:6702)
- Doctor component: "Goblinstein_doctor" (gamedata.json:6750)
- Monster component: Referenced in summonCharacterSecondData
- Ability: "Goblinstein_ability" (gamedata.json:6777)
- Aura buff: "Goblinstein_doctor_aura" (gamedata.json:6785)

### Technical Debt
- Requires champion ability framework
- Needs dual-unit spawning system
- Projectile buff integration incomplete
- Building-only targeting logic exists but not tested with this card
