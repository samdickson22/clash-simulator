# Valkyrie Card Implementation Audit

## Card Information
- **Name**: Valkyrie
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop (Rare)
- **Type**: Ground-targeting melee troop with area damage

## Implemented
- Basic troop spawning and movement (entities.py:240-290, battle.py:_spawn_troop)
- Ground targeting only (gamedata.json:attacksGround: true)
- Area damage mechanics (entities.py:72-107, gamedata.json:areaDamageRadius: 2000)
- Standard combat stats: hitpoints, damage, range, sight range, speed (gamedata.json)
- Collision radius for hitbox detection (gamedata.json:collisionRadius: 500)
- Target acquisition with troop/building priority (entities.py:159-214)
- Bridge navigation and pathfinding (entities.py:427-690)

## Missing
- **360° area damage**: Currently implemented as standard splash damage, but Valkyrie's spin attack should hit all enemies around her simultaneously
- **Melee attack animation**: Current implementation treats it as standard direct damage, but should have distinctive spinning melee attack
- **Visual effects**: No spinning animation or visual distinction for area melee attacks

## Notes
- Card exists in gamedata.json with complete stat profile
- Uses generic Troop class implementation - no Valkyrie-specific code found
- Area damage radius is set (2000 units = 2 tiles) but may need tuning for 360° effect
- All core functionality exists through generic troop systems, just missing Valkyrie-specific visual/mechanic flavor
- Evolution mechanics (EVOS) were excluded from this audit as requested
