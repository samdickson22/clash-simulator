# X-Bow Card Implementation Audit

## Card Overview
- **Card**: X-Bow
- **Elixir**: 6
- **Category**: Building
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Type**: Ground-targeting defensive building

## Implemented
- **Basic Building Framework**: Building entity class with attack logic (src/clasher/entities.py:692-766)
- **Projectile System**: Buildings can fire projectiles using projectileData (src/clasher/entities.py:718-765)
- **Ground Targeting**: Building only targets ground units (tidTarget: "TID_TARGETS_GROUND")
- **Range System**: Long-range building with 11.5 tile range (range: 11500 in gamedata.json)
- **Deploy Time**: 3.5 second deploy time (deployTime: 3500 in gamedata.json)
- **Hitpoints**: 625 HP at base level (hitpoints: 625 in gamedata.json)
- **Lifetime**: 30 second building lifetime (lifeTime: 30000 in gamedata.json)
- **Collision Radius**: 0.6 tile collision radius (collisionRadius: 600 in gamedata.json)
- **Attack Speed**: 0.3 second attack interval (hitSpeed: 300 in gamedata.json)
- **Damage Scaling**: Entity damage scales with card level system

## Missing
- **X-Bow Projectile**: xbow_projectile (damage: 17, speed: 1400) - projectile exists in gamedata but no specific X-Bow implementation
- **Building Spawn Logic**: No specific X-Bow spawn handling - uses generic building spawn
- **Visual Distinction**: No unique X-Bow visualization or model
- **Special Mechanics**: No unique X-Bow-specific behaviors implemented
- **Name Mapping**: Card name mapping from "Xbow" in code to "X-Bow" display name

## Notes
- X-Bow uses the generic Building entity class in src/clasher/entities.py
- All core building mechanics are implemented through the base Building class
- Projectile system exists but X-Bow's specific projectile (xbow_projectile) has no unique handling
- The card is registered in gamedata.json with correct Epic rarity and 6 elixir cost
- Building spawning is handled through _spawn_entity method in battle.py:615-635
- No X-Bow-specific special mechanics or visual effects are implemented
- Card appears to be functionally complete as a basic ranged building but lacks X-Bow-specific identity
