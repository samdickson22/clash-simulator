# Princess Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Princess
- **Elixir**: 3
- **Category**: Troop (Legendary)
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Type**: Character

## Official Mechanics (Clash Royale Wiki)
- Longest range in game (9 tiles)
- Area damage with splash radius
- Low hitpoints
- Slow attack rate
- Air & Ground targeting
- Projectile attacks

## gamedata.json Capabilities
Based on examination of gamedata.json:

### Core Stats
- Hitpoints: 102
- Damage: 66 (area damage)
- Range: 9000 (9 tiles)
- Sight Range: 9500 (9.5 tiles)
- Speed: 60 tiles/min
- Hit Speed: 3000ms (3 seconds)
- Area Damage Radius: 2500 (2.5 tiles)

### Projectile System
- Uses projectile-based attacks
- Projectile speed: 600
- Multiple projectiles: 5
- Custom first projectile: "PrincessProjectile" with area damage
- Regular projectile: "PrincessProjectileDeco"

### Targeting
- Targets: Air and Ground (TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND)
- Attacks Ground: true

### Deployment
- Deploy Time: 1200ms
- Load Time: 2700ms
- Collision Radius: 500 (0.5 tiles)

## Implemented Features

### ✅ Core Entity System (src/clasher/entities.py)
- **Base Troop class**: Princess inherits from generic Troop entity with movement, attack, and targeting logic
- **Projectile support**: Generic projectile system handles Princess arrows (entities.py:323-400)
- **Area damage**: Splash damage system implemented (entities.py:72-106)
- **Targeting logic**: Air/Ground targeting and priority targeting system (entities.py:159-214)
- **Movement**: Bridge navigation and pathfinding system (entities.py:427-690)

### ✅ Card Data Loading (src/clasher/data.py)
- **Data loading**: Princess stats loaded from gamedata.json (data.py:107-237)
- **Projectile data**: Multiple projectiles and custom first projectile handled
- **Area damage radius**: Properly converted from game units to tiles

### ✅ Battle Integration (src/clasher/battle.py)
- **Troop spawning**: _spawn_troop() creates Princess instances (battle.py)
- **Projectile creation**: _create_projectile() handles Princess arrows
- **Area damage**: Splash damage applied to multiple targets

## Missing Features

### ❌ Princess-Specific Mechanics
- **Multiple projectile visualization**: System supports multiple projectiles but Princess's 5-arrow pattern not specifically implemented
- **Custom projectile behavior**: "PrincessProjectile" vs "PrincessProjectileDeco" distinction not handled
- **Projectile timing**: Staggered multi-projectile launch timing not implemented

### ❌ Visual/Aesthetic Features
- **Bow animation**: No specific bow drawing/aiming animations
- **Arrow effects**: No special visual effects for arrows
- **Princess model**: No 3D model or sprite implementation

## Notes

### Implementation Status
- Princess is **partially implemented** as a generic troop
- All core combat mechanics work through the base systems
- Missing: Princess-specific visual and projectile differentiation

### Name Mapping
- gamedata.json references: "Princess", "PrincessProjectile", "PrincessProjectileDeco"
- Code uses generic "Princess" name for entity creation

### Assumptions
- Princess uses standard Troop class with projectile capabilities
- Area damage and splash radius handled by generic systems
- Multiple projectiles treated as single damage instance in current implementation

### Technical Gaps
- No Princess-specific class or customization
- Multi-projectile visual effects not implemented
- Custom projectile types not differentiated in gameplay logic
