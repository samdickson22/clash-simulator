# Cannon Card Implementation Audit

## Card Overview
- **Name**: Cannon
- **Elixir**: 3
- **Category**: Building
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Unlock Arena**: Arena3

## Implemented
- ✅ Building entity system (`src/clasher/entities.py:693-766`)
- ✅ Basic building mechanics (stationary, lifetime-based)
- ✅ Projectile attacks with TowerCannonball projectile
- ✅ Ground targeting only (`tidTarget: "TID_TARGETS_GROUND"`)
- ✅ Standard building lifecycle (30 second lifetime)
- ✅ Hitpoint scaling system
- ✅ Card data loading from gamedata.json (`src/clasher/data.py:102-300`)
- ✅ Building spawning system (`src/clasher/battle.py:spawn_troop`)

## Missing
- ❌ Specific Cannon visual assets not referenced in code
- ❌ Evolution mechanics (EV1 data present in gamedata.json but evolution system not implemented)

## Notes
- Cannon is implemented through the generic Building class with no special mechanics
- Uses standard projectile system with TowerCannonball projectile
- All core mechanics are present: lifetime, HP, damage, range, attack speed
- Gamedata shows: 322 HP, 83 damage, 5.5 range, 1.0s attack speed, 30s lifetime
- No special gimmicks or abilities detected in gamedata.json
- Evolution data exists but evolution system not implemented in current codebase

**Status**: Fully implemented as standard defensive building
