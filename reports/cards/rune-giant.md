# Rune Giant (GiantBuffer) Implementation Audit

## Card Information
- **Card**: Rune Giant
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Internal Name**: GiantBuffer

## Implemented Mechanics
### ✅ Basic Troop Implementation
- **Entity Framework**: src/clasher/entities.py:240-690 (Troop class)
- **Movement**: Standard ground troop movement with bridge pathfinding
- **Targeting**: Buildings only (targets_only_buildings: true)
- **Combat**: Basic attack system with hit cooldown

### ✅ Core Stats from gamedata.json
- **Hitpoints**: 1040
- **Damage**: 47
- **Range**: 1200 (1.2 tiles)
- **Speed**: 60 (tiles/min)
- **Hit Speed**: 1500ms
- **Sight Range**: 7500 (7.5 tiles)
- **Collision Radius**: 750 (0.75 tiles)
- **Deploy Time**: 1000ms

## Missing Mechanics
### ❌ Unique Ability: Troop Buffing
**Source**: gamedata.json - `onStartingActionData` with `Giantbuffer_collect_friend_troops`
- **Mechanic**: Should collect up to 2 friendly troops and buff them
- **Buff Effect**: +86 damage and +86 crown tower damage (from `actionWhenUnitBuffedData`)
- **Projectile**: Uses `GiantBuffProjectile` for buff delivery
- **Target Filter**: `friendly_troops_for_chef_giant_buffer`

### ❌ On-Deploy Action
**Source**: gamedata.json - `onStartingActionData`
- **Mechanic**: Should trigger buff collection immediately on spawn
- **Current State**: No on-deploy action system implemented

### ❌ Ability System
**Source**: gamedata.json - `abilityData` with `Giantbuffer_ability`
- **Mechanic**: Has ability with `ActionPlayEffect` on activation
- **Current State**: No ability system for troops implemented

### ❌ Visual Effects
**Source**: gamedata.json - `visualActionForEnemyTargetData`
- **Mechanic**: Visual effect when buffing enemy targets
- **Duration**: 250ms damage merge effect
- **Current State**: No visual effect system for buffs

## Notes
- **Name Mapping**: Card is internally named "GiantBuffer" but displays as "Rune Giant"
- **Card Type**: Correctly classified as troop with `TID_CARD_TYPE_CHARACTER`
- **Targeting**: Properly configured to only target buildings (`TID_TARGETS_BUILDINGS`)
- **Implementation Gap**: Core troop functionality exists, but signature buff ability is completely missing
- **Complexity**: The buff mechanic requires significant new systems:
  - On-deploy action triggering
  - Friendly troop collection and filtering
  - Buff application and duration management
  - Projectile-based buff delivery
  - Visual effect system

## Implementation Priority
**HIGH** - The buff mechanic is the defining feature of Rune Giant and completely absent from current implementation. Without it, the card functions as a basic building-targeting troop with no unique gameplay value.
