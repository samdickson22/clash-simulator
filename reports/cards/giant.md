# Giant Card Audit Report

## Card Information
- **Name**: Giant
- **Elixir**: 5
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Type**: Village

## Gamedata.json Analysis
Based on gamedata.json, the Giant has the following explicit capabilities:
- **Hitpoints**: 1598
- **Damage**: 99
- **Speed**: 45 tiles/min
- **Attack Range**: 1.2 tiles
- **Sight Range**: 7.5 tiles
- **Hit Speed**: 1500ms
- **Targeting**: Buildings only (TID_TARGETS_BUILDINGS)
- **Ground attacks only**: True
- **Collision Radius**: 0.75 tiles
- **Deploy Time**: 1000ms
- **Load Time**: 1000ms

## Implemented Features

### Core Mechanics ✅
- **Basic troop spawning**: Implemented via `battle.py:162` `_spawn_troop()` method
- **Building-only targeting**: Implemented via `entities.py:169-171` and `entities.py:204-207` - Giant ignores troops and only targets buildings
- **Movement system**: Implemented via `entities.py:251-427` Troop class with ground movement
- **Attack system**: Implemented via `entities.py:292-308` direct melee attacks (no projectiles)
- **Health/damage scaling**: Implemented via `data.py:91-100` level-based stat scaling

### Targeting Logic ✅
- **Building prioritization**: Giant correctly ignores all troop targets via `entities.py:200-201`
- **Sight range limitations**: Giant only detects buildings within 7.5 tile sight range
- **Bridge pathfinding**: Giant uses proper bridge navigation via `entities.py:427-545`

### Statistics Integration ✅
- **Card data loading**: Giant stats loaded from gamedata.json via `data.py:107-237`
- **Collision detection**: Giant uses 0.75 tile collision radius from gamedata
- **Speed/damage/hitpoints**: All core combat stats properly integrated

## Missing Features

### None Detected
Based on gamedata.json analysis, the Giant has no special mechanics beyond basic building-only targeting. All explicitly defined capabilities are implemented:

- ✅ No special abilities/abilities in gamedata
- ✅ No death spawn mechanics
- ✅ No projectile/ranged attacks
- ✅ No charging mechanics
- ✅ No aura/buff effects
- ✅ No evolution mechanics (excluded per requirements)

## Notes

### Implementation Completeness
The Giant implementation is **complete** based on gamedata.json specification. The Giant functions as a basic melee troop with building-only targeting, which matches both the gamedata definition and official Clash Royale mechanics.

### Key Integration Points
- **Targeting system**: `entities.py:169-207` handles building-only targeting logic
- **Spawning system**: `battle.py:162` routes Giant to `_spawn_troop()`
- **Data integration**: `data.py:202` correctly maps `TID_TARGETS_BUILDINGS` to `targets_only_buildings=True`

### Name Mapping
- Card name: "Giant" (consistent across gamedata and codebase)
- No special character variants or alternate names detected

### Assumptions
- Giant uses standard ground troop movement (no special pathfinding rules)
- Giant has no ranged/projectile capabilities (melee only)
- Standard level scaling applies (1.1x multiplier per level)
