# Wizard Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Wizard
- **Elixir**: 5
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Type**: Ground troop with area damage projectiles

## Implemented
- Basic troop mechanics (movement, targeting, attacks) - `src/clasher/entities.py:240`
- Area damage splash system - `src/clasher/entities.py:91-106`
- Projectile system with splash radius - `src/clasher/entities.py:318-400`
- Air and ground targeting - `src/clasher/entities.py:173-176`
- Hitbox-based collision detection - `src/clasher/entities.py:98-106`
- Status effect system (stun, slow) - `src/clasher/entities.py:108-135`
- Bridge pathfinding for ground units - `src/clasher/entities.py:495-689`
- Target priority system (troops > buildings) - `src/clasher/entities.py:164-214`

## Missing
- Death spawn effect (spawns Ice Spirit on death)
- Evolution mechanics (shield and enhanced abilities)
- Custom death animation/sound effects
- Specific Wizard visual effects (fireball casting animation)

## Notes
- Wizard mechanics are largely implemented through the base Troop class and projectile system
- Area damage is handled by the generic splash damage system in `_deal_attack_damage`
- Projectile system supports the Wizard's fireball attacks with proper splash radius
- No special Wizard-specific code found - relies on generic troop/projectile systems
- Evolution features are explicitly excluded per requirements
- The implementation covers core gameplay mechanics but lacks cosmetic/death spawn features
