# Inferno Tower Implementation Audit

## Card Info
- **Card**: Inferno Tower
- **Elixir**: 5
- **Category**: Building
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **ID**: 27000003

## Gamedata.json Capabilities
From `/Users/sam/Desktop/code/clasher/gamedata.json`:
- Basic building stats: 683 HP, 17 base damage, 6000 range
- Variable damage system: `variableDamage2: 62`, `variableDamage3: 331`
- Fast attack speed: 400ms hitSpeed, 1200ms loadTime
- Targets both air and ground: `tidTarget: "TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND"`
- Standard building properties: 30s lifetime, 600 collision radius

## Implemented
- **Base Building class**: `src/clasher/entities.py:Building` - Basic building framework exists
- **Standard targeting**: Air/ground targeting support in entities.py
- **Attack system**: Basic attack mechanics with hitSpeed/loadTime processing in battle.py
- **Health system**: Building HP and damage handling implemented

## Missing
- **Variable damage scaling**: Core mechanic where damage increases over time (variableDamage1=20, variableDamage2=62, variableDamage3=331)
- **Progressive damage ramp**: No implementation of damage scaling based on attack duration
- **Beam/visual effects**: No continuous beam attack visualization
- **Damage tracking per target**: No system to track individual target engagement time
- **Specialized building class**: No InfernoTower-specific implementation beyond generic Building class

## Notes
- **Name mapping**: gamedata uses "InfernoTower" (camelCase) while official name is "Inferno Tower"
- **Core mechanic gap**: The defining feature - progressive damage scaling - is completely missing
- **Data handling**: variableDamage fields in gamedata.json are not processed or used anywhere in codebase
- **Implementation status**: Only basic building functionality exists, missing the unique damage-over-time ramping mechanic that makes Inferno Tower distinctive
