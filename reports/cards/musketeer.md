# Musketeer Card Implementation Audit

## Card Information
- **Card**: Musketeer
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Type**: Ranged troop

## Gamedata.json Analysis
The Musketeer card has the following characteristics from gamedata.json:
- **Mana Cost**: 4
- **Hitpoints**: 282
- **Damage**: 85
- **Range**: 6000 (6 tiles)
- **Speed**: 60
- **Hit Speed**: 1000 (1 second)
- **Sight Range**: 6000
- **Target Type**: Air and Ground
- **Collision Radius**: 500
- **Projectile**: MusketeerProjectile (speed: 1000, damage: 85)

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Basic troop movement and pathfinding (`entities.py:240-690`)
- ✅ Projectile-based ranged attacks (`entities.py:317-400`)
- ✅ Air and ground targeting (`entities.py:173-177,189-191`)
- ✅ Target prioritization (troops > buildings) (`entities.py:159-214`)
- ✅ Status effect system (stun, slow) (`entities.py:108-135`)
- ✅ Bridge pathfinding for ground units (`entities.py:495-690`)
- ✅ Hitbox-based collision detection (`entities.py:813-825`)
- ✅ Sight range mechanics (`entities.py:193-198,528-533`)

## Missing Features
- ❌ No specific Musketeer class or implementation found
- ❌ MusketeerProjectile not implemented as a separate projectile type
- ❌ No unique Musketeer mechanics or abilities
- ❌ Not explicitly registered in any spell/troop registry

## Notes
- The Musketeer appears to rely entirely on the generic `Troop` class implementation
- The card data exists in gamedata.json but no specific Musketeer implementation was found in the codebase
- The generic projectile system in `entities.py` should handle Musketeer's ranged attacks
- Musketeer's mechanics are straightforward (ranged single-target damage) and well-covered by the base troop system
- No special gimmicks or unique abilities detected in gamedata.json that would require custom implementation
