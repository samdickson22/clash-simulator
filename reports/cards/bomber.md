- ✅ **Projectile system** (entities.py:768-826, 323-401)
- ✅ **Ground targeting** (entities.py:141-157, 174-176)
- ✅ **Collision detection** (entities.py:98-107, 813-826)
- ✅ **Bridge pathfinding** (entities.py:495-690)
- ✅ **Target prioritization** (entities.py:159-236)
- ✅ **Attack cooldown system** (entities.py:267-307)

## Missing Features
- ❌ **Bomber-specific entity class** - No dedicated Bomber class exists
- ❌ **Card registration** - Bomber is not registered in SPELL_REGISTRY or card system
- ❌ **Troop deployment** - Bomber cannot be deployed as it's not in the card system
- ❌ **Visual/audio feedback** - No bomber-specific animations or sounds
- ❌ **Level scaling** - Card stats not properly scaled by level

## Notes
- Bomber data exists in gamedata.json with complete stats
- The codebase has all necessary systems for area damage troops (projectiles, collision, targeting)
- Main gap is that Bomber is not integrated into the card deployment system
- Entity system in entities.py supports all required mechanics (area damage, projectiles, ground targeting)
- No special gimmicks or unique mechanics for Bomber - it's a straightforward area damage troop
- Evolution data exists in gamedata.json but is excluded per requirements
