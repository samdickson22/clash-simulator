# Skeletons Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Skeletons
- **Elixir**: 1
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Type**: Character

## Implemented ✅
- Basic card loading and stats from gamedata.json
- Elixir cost (1 mana)
- Summon count (3 skeletons)
- Summon radius (0.7 tiles / 700 game units)
- Individual Skeleton unit stats:
  - Hitpoints: 32
  - Damage: 32
  - Range: 0.5 tiles (melee)
  - Sight range: 5.5 tiles
  - Speed: 90.0 tiles/min
  - Hit speed: 1000ms
  - Deploy time: 1000ms
  - Load time: 500ms
  - Collision radius: 0.5 tiles
- Ground targeting only
- Swarm spawning system (circular formation)
- Troop movement and pathfinding
- Basic combat mechanics
- Health and damage scaling by level

## Missing ❌
- **No special mechanics detected** - Card appears to be implemented as a basic swarm troop
- No charge/dash mechanics
- No death spawn effects
- No projectiles or ranged attacks
- No aura or area effects
- No special targeting rules
- No immunity or resistance mechanics
- No evolution mechanics (excluded per requirements)

## Notes
- Card uses standard swarm troop spawning logic in `battle.py:524-544`
- Skeletons spawn in circular formation with randomized positioning
- Individual Skeleton units use generic Troop class from `entities.py`
- No dedicated Skeleton entity class - uses base Troop implementation
- Card properly loads individual Skeleton character data from gamedata.json
- All mechanics match standard ground troop behavior with swarm deployment
- Implementation appears complete for basic functionality based on gamedata.json specification

**Status**: Basic swarm troop functionality appears fully implemented
