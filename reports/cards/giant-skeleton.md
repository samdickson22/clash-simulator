# Giant Skeleton Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Giant Skeleton
- **Elixir**: 6
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Type**: Ground troop with death bomb mechanic

## Official Mechanics (Clash Royale)
Based on official Clash Royale sources:
- Slow-moving ground troop (Speed: Slow)
- Moderate hitpoints and damage
- Attacks buildings only (like most giants)
- **Death Bomb**: When destroyed, drops a bomb that deals significant area damage
- Bomb affects both ground and air units
- Bomb damage can destroy Crown Towers

## Gamedata.json Analysis
Key capabilities found:
- **Death Spawn**: `deathSpawnCount: 1`, spawns `GiantSkeletonBomb`
- **Bomb Properties**:
  - `deathDamage: 209`
  - `crownTowerDamagePercent: 100`
  - Targets: `TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND`
  - `collisionRadius: 450`
- **Troop Stats**:
  - Hitpoints: 1413
  - Damage: 104
  - Speed: 60 (Slow)
  - Range: 800 (Melee)
  - Target: `TID_TARGETS_GROUND`

## Implementation Status

### Implemented
- ✅ **Basic Troop Functionality**: Movement, attack, targeting via `Troop` class (`src/clasher/entities.py:240`)
- ✅ **Death Spawn System**: Complete death spawn handling in `battle.py` (`_spawn_death_units` method)
- ✅ **Bomb Entity**: `GiantSkeletonBomb` data with proper targeting (air + ground)
- ✅ **Area Damage**: Bomb deals area damage via death spawn mechanics
- ✅ **Crown Tower Damage**: Bomb configured for 100% crown tower damage
- ✅ **Collision Detection**: Proper hitbox collision for bomb explosion

### Missing
- ❌ **Card Registration**: No specific Giant Skeleton class or registration found
- ❌ **Visual Effects**: Death bomb explosion visual effects not implemented
- ❌ **Sound Effects**: Death bomb explosion sounds not implemented
- ❌ **Bomb Deploy Animation**: 3-second bomb deploy timer (`deployTime: 3000`) not visually represented

## Notes
- **Name Mapping**: Uses "GiantSkeleton" internally (no space)
- **Architecture**: Death spawn system is robust and handles Giant Skeleton's bomb mechanic
- **Data Integration**: All necessary gamedata.json properties are properly integrated
- **Bomb Behavior**: The `GiantSkeletonBomb` is treated as a building-type entity that explodes immediately
- **Combat Integration**: Bomb damage uses standard area damage system with collision detection

## Implementation Quality
The Giant Skeleton's core mechanic (death bomb) is **fully implemented** through the generic death spawn system. The bomb has correct damage values, targeting, and area effects. Missing elements are primarily cosmetic (visual/sound effects) rather than functional gameplay mechanics.
