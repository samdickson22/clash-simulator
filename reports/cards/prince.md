## Implemented Features
- ✅ **Troop class foundation** - Inherits from Troop entity (src/clasher/entities.py:78)
- ✅ **Charging mechanics** - Full charge system with distance tracking (src/clasher/entities.py:89-93, 130-141)
- ✅ **Charge damage** - Special damage handling for charge attacks (src/clasher/entities.py:118-123)
- ✅ **Speed modification** - Charge speed multiplier support (src/clasher/entities.py:139-140)
- ✅ **Ground targeting** - Target type properly configured
- ✅ **Bridge pathfinding** - Navigates bridges appropriately (src/clasher/entities.py:169-194)

## Missing Features
- ❌ **Jump mechanics** - River jumping ability not implemented
- ❌ **Prince-specific class** - No dedicated Prince class in codebase
- ❌ **Visual effects** - No charge/jump visual effects

## Notes
- Prince relies on generic Troop class with charging capabilities
- Charge system is well-implemented with distance tracking and damage multipliers
- Bridge pathfinding works correctly for ground troops
- Missing jump mechanic would prevent river crossing behavior
- No Prince-specific customizations beyond standard troop features
