# Tesla Card Implementation Audit

## Card Information
- **Card**: Tesla
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Building
- **Rarity**: Common

## Gamedata.json Analysis
From Tesla's building data in gamedata.json:
- **Hitpoints**: 450
- **Damage**: 86
- **Range**: 5500 (5.5 tiles)
- **Sight Range**: 5500 (5.5 tiles)
- **Hit Speed**: 1100ms (1.1 seconds)
- **Load Time**: 700ms (0.7 seconds)
- **Deploy Time**: 1000ms (1 second)
- **Lifetime**: 30000ms (30 seconds)
- **Collision Radius**: 500 (0.5 tiles)
- **Target Type**: Air and Ground ("TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND")

## Implemented Features
- **Building base mechanics** - All buildings inherit from `Building` class (entities.py:692-766)
- **Basic attack system** - Buildings can attack targets in range (entities.py:715-726)
- **Target acquisition** - Buildings find nearest valid targets (entities.py:159-214)
- **Attack cooldown** - Based on hitSpeed from card data (entities.py:725)
- **Status effects** - Buildings support stun/slow effects (entities.py:701-706)
- **Projectile support** - Framework exists if Tesla uses projectiles (entities.py:718-720, 734-765)
- **Air/ground targeting** - Framework supports targeting both air and ground units (entities.py:173-177)

## Missing Features
- **Tesla-specific implementation** - No Tesla-specific code found in codebase
- **Electric beam/chain lightning** - Tesla's signature electric attack mechanics not implemented
- **Retargeting behavior** - Tesla's ability to quickly switch targets not specifically implemented
- **Deploy timing** - Tesla's deploy time behavior may need specific handling
- **Load timing** - Tesla's load time before first attack may need specific handling

## Notes
- **Name mapping**: Tesla card exists in gamedata.json as "Tesla" with building type
- **Assumptions**: Tesla would use standard building mechanics but lacks specialized electric attack behavior
- **Implementation gap**: While the building framework exists, Tesla's unique electric attack mechanics are not implemented
- **Evolution excluded**: Tesla_EV1 evolution data exists in gamedata.json but was excluded per requirements

 Tesla appears to be a standard defensive building in the current implementation framework, but lacks its signature electric attack mechanics that define its gameplay in Clash Royale.
