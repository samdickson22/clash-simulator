# Electro Giant Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Electro Giant
- **Elixir**: 7
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Type**: Building-targeting melee troop with reflected electrical attack

## Implemented
- Basic troop mechanics (src/clasher/entities.py:165)
- Ground movement and targeting (src/clasher/entities.py:166)
- Standard combat system (src/clasher/entities.py:72-100)
- Health and damage systems (src/clasher/entities.py:66-70)

## Missing
- **Reflected attack mechanic** - Electro Giant's signature ability to zap attackers (gamedata.json:reflectedAttackRadius, reflectedAttackDamage, reflectedAttackBuffDuration)
- **Zap/Freeze debuff** - Applied to attackers via reflectedAttackBuffData (gamedata.json:reflectedAttackBuffData)
- **Building-only targeting** - Currently targets both ground/air, should only target buildings (gamedata.json:tidTarget: "TID_TARGETS_BUILDINGS")
- **Crown tower damage reflection** - Special damage calculation for crown towers (gamedata.json:reflectAttackCrownTowerDamage)
- **Multiple target reflection** - Limited reflected attacks per target (gamedata.json:reflectedAttackTargetedEffectSources)

## Notes
- Card exists in gamedata.json as "ElectroGiant" (line 26000085)
- No specific Electro Giant class found in codebase
- Reflected attack mechanics appear completely unimplemented
- The core gimmick (zapping attackers when hit) is missing from the engine
- Current troop class would need significant extension to support reflection mechanics
