# Inferno Dragon Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Inferno Dragon
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Type**: Air unit

## Implemented
- Basic troop spawning and movement (src/clasher/battle.py:734, 748, 762)
- Air unit classification (recognized in air_units list)
- Basic stats integration (hitpoints, damage, speed, range)

## Missing
- **Variable/increasing damage over time** - gamedata.json shows `damage: 14`, `variableDamage2: 47`, `variableDamage3: 165` indicating scaling damage mechanic
- **Beam attack system** - gamedata.json references beam effects and attack sequences
- **Load time mechanic** - gamedata.json shows `loadTime: 1200` for attack windup
- **Targeted damage effects** - specific beam visual effects not implemented
- **Attack sequence system** - evolution data shows multi-stage attack progression
- **Decay counter mechanics** - for damage scaling reset when switching targets

## Notes
- Card is treated as generic troop without specialized mechanics
- No dedicated InfernoDragon class exists in entities.py
- Variable damage scaling (core mechanic) is completely missing
- Beam/continuous attack system not implemented
- Evolution mechanics present in gamedata but excluded per requirements
