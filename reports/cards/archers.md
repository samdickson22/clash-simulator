# Archers Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Archers
- **Elixir**: 3
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Tribe**: Village
- **Type**: Character (TID_CARD_TYPE_CHARACTER)
- **Unlock Arena**: TrainingCamp

## Official Mechanics (from gamedata.json)
- **Summon Count**: 2 Archer units
- **Unit Name**: Archer
- **Sight Range**: 5500 game units (5.5 tiles)
- **Deploy Time**: 1000ms (1.0 second)
- **Speed**: 60 tiles/minute (1.0 tiles/second)
- **Hitpoints**: 119
- **Hit Speed**: 900ms (0.9 seconds)
- **Load Time**: 400ms (0.4 seconds)
- **Range**: 5000 game units (5.0 tiles)
- **Attack Type**: Ground only (`attacksGround: true`)
- **Target Type**: Air and Ground (`tidTarget: TID_TARGETS_AIR_AND_GROUND`)
- **Speed Tier**: TID_SPEED_3
- **Collision Radius**: 500 game units (0.5 tiles)

### Projectile Mechanics
- **Projectile Name**: ArcherArrow
- **Projectile Speed**: 600 tiles/minute (10 tiles/second)
- **Projectile Damage**: 42
- **Damage Type**: Ranged damage (`TID_SPELL_ATTRIBUTE_RANGED_DAMAGE`)

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Basic troop spawning (2 Archer units)
- ✅ Ground troop movement and pathfinding
- ✅ Projectile-based ranged attacks
- ✅ Air and ground targeting capability
- ✅ Standard combat mechanics (hp, damage, range, speed)
- ✅ Collision detection and hitbox system
- ✅ Bridge navigation and arena pathfinding
- ✅ Attack cooldown system
- ✅ Status effect handling (stun, slow)

## Missing Features
- ❌ No specific Archer card implementation found in codebase
- ❌ No dedicated Archer class or entity type
- ❌ No Archer-specific projectile handling
- ❌ No ArcherArrow projectile class implementation
- ❌ No card-specific visual effects or animations
- ❌ No Archer summon logic in battle system
- ❌ No Archer card in spell registry or character system

## Notes
- **Name Mapping**: The card is called "Archers" in gamedata.json but spawns individual "Archer" units
- **Status**: Only basic troop infrastructure exists; no Archers-specific implementation
- **Gamedata Integration**: Archers card data exists in gamedata.json but is not utilized by the codebase
- **Implementation Gap**: The codebase has a generic troop system but no card-specific Archer implementation
- **Reference in Code**: Archers appear in player.py default hand/deck lists but are not implemented as playable cards

## Assessment
The Archers card is **NOT IMPLEMENTED** in the codebase. While the foundational troop system exists with projectile support, there is no specific implementation for Archers. The card data exists in gamedata.json but the codebase does not have:
1. A dedicated Archer entity class
2. Archers card deployment logic
3. ArcherArrow projectile implementation
4. Integration with the card spawning system

**Implementation Priority**: HIGH - Archers are a fundamental Common card and should be implemented to validate the core troop and projectile systems.
