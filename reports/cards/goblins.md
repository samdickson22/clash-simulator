# Goblins Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Goblins
- **Elixir**: 2
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Tribe**: Goblin
- **Type**: Character (summons multiple units)

## Implemented
- **Basic troop spawning mechanics**: General Troop class in `entities.py:240` handles movement, targeting, and combat
- **Ground troop targeting**: Can only target ground units (`attacksGround: true` in gamedata)
- **Melee combat**: Short range (500 units = 0.5 tiles) for direct attacks
- **Speed**: Fast movement (120 tiles/min) implemented in Troop movement system
- **Health**: 79 HP per goblin with standard damage scaling
- **Damage**: 47 damage per attack with 1100ms hit speed
- **Multi-unit deployment**: Spawns 4 goblins with 700 unit radius and 200ms deploy delay
- **Collision detection**: 500 unit collision radius for proper hitbox interaction
- **Sight range**: 5500 units for target acquisition
- **Standard deployment**: 1000ms deploy time and 500ms load time

## Missing
- **Individual goblin AI**: Current implementation treats all spawned goblins as identical entities without individual behavior variations
- **Goblin-specific pathfinding**: No special pathfinding rules for goblin groups (they use standard troop pathfinding)
- **Swarm coordination**: No special coordination between spawned goblins (they operate independently)
- **Visual differentiation**: No unique visual indicators for goblins vs other melee troops

## Notes
- **Name mapping**: Card uses "Goblins" name but spawns "Goblin_Stab" characters from gamedata
- **Mechanics simplicity**: Goblins are basic melee troops with no special abilities, charging, or unique mechanics
- **Implementation completeness**: Core functionality is implemented through the general Troop class system
- **Data source**: All capabilities confirmed from gamedata.json entry for card ID 26000002
- **No evolution**: Card has no evolution data in gamedata.json

The Goblins card is functionally complete as a basic melee troop spawner. All core mechanics are implemented through the existing troop system, though there are no goblin-specific special behaviors beyond standard melee combat.
