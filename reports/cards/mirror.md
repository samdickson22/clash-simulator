# Mirror Card Audit Report

## Card, Elixir, Category
- **Card**: Mirror
- **Elixir**: 1 (base cost, varies based on mirrored card)
- **Category**: Spell
- **Rarity**: Epic

## Implemented
- Basic spell registration in `src/clasher/spells.py:455` as `DirectDamageSpell` with 0 damage and 0 radius
- Dynamic spell type detection in `src/clasher/dynamic_spells.py:82` recognizes Mirror as special case
- Comment indicating "Special case - handled in battle logic" but no actual special handling found

## Missing
- **Core mechanic**: Ability to copy the last played card (completely missing)
- **Elixir calculation**: Dynamic cost based on mirrored card + 1 elixir
- **Level increase**: Mirrored card should be +1 level higher
- **Card history tracking**: No system to track last played card per player
- **Mirrored card deployment**: No logic to create and deploy the copied card
- **Visual effects**: No mirror-specific visualization or feedback
- **Sound effects**: No mirror sound implementation

## Notes
- Mirror is only defined as a placeholder `DirectDamageSpell` with zero damage and zero radius
- No actual mirror functionality exists in the codebase
- The comment "Special case - handled in battle logic" appears to be incorrect or refers to unimplemented functionality
- Gamedata.json contains minimal Mirror data: only basic card info (name, cost, rarity, etc.) with no special mechanics defined
- This is essentially a stub implementation that would do nothing if cast
