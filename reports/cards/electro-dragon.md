# Electro Dragon Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Electro Dragon
- **Elixir**: 5
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Type**: Air unit

## Implemented
- Basic troop spawning and movement (src/clasher/battle.py:45-60 - air unit detection)
- Basic projectile system (src/clasher/entities.py:515-620 - Projectile class)
- General stun/freeze effect system (src/clasher/entities.py:115-140 - stun_timer, apply_stun())
- Status effect management (src/clasher/entities.py:150-165 - update_status_effects())
- Hitbox-based collision detection (src/clasher/entities.py:320-350 - _hitbox_overlaps_with_area())

## Missing
- **Chain lightning mechanic** - gamedata.json shows `"chainedHitCount": 3` but no chain implementation exists in Projectile class
- **Electro Dragon-specific projectile** - gamedata.json defines ElectroDragonProjectile with `"buffTime": 500` and ZapFreeze buff data, but no special projectile class exists
- **Zap/stun effect on projectile hit** - gamedata.json shows targetBuffData with ZapFreeze (hitSpeedMultiplier: -100, speedMultiplier: -100) but projectile impact doesn't apply buffs
- **Chain targeting logic** - No mechanism to find secondary targets within chain range
- **Damage chaining** - Primary projectile only deals splash damage, doesn't chain to additional targets

## Notes
- Card is recognized as air unit in battle.py spawn logic
- Basic projectile framework exists but lacks Electro Dragon's signature chain lightning
- ZapFreeze buff data in gamedata.json suggests 0.5s stun effect should be applied
- No specialized ElectroDragon class or projectile implementation found
- Current Projectile class only supports single target + splash damage, not chaining
