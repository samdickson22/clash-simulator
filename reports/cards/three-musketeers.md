# Three Musketeers Card Implementation Audit

## Card Information
- **Card**: Three Musketeers
- **Elixir**: 9
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Type**: Multiple troop deployment

## Gamedata.json Analysis
The Three Musketeers card has the following characteristics from gamedata.json:
- **Mana Cost**: 9
- **Summon Number**: 3 (spawns three Musketeers)
- **Summon Deploy Delay**: 100 (0.1 seconds between spawns)
- **Character**: ThreeMusketeer (uses same stats as regular Musketeer)
- **Hitpoints**: 282 per Musketeer
- **Damage**: 85 per Musketeer
- **Range**: 6000 (6 tiles)
- **Speed**: 60
- **Hit Speed**: 1000 (1 second)
- **Sight Range**: 6000
- **Target Type**: Air and Ground
- **Collision Radius**: 500
- **Projectile**: MusketeerProjectile (speed: 1000, damage: 85)

## Implemented Features
- ✅ Basic troop movement and pathfinding (`entities.py:240-690`)
- ✅ Projectile-based ranged attacks (`entities.py:317-400`)
- ✅ Air and ground targeting (`entities.py:173-177,189-191`)
- ✅ Target prioritization (troops > buildings) (`entities.py:159-214`)
- ✅ Status effect system (stun, slow) (`entities.py:108-135`)
- ✅ Bridge pathfinding for ground units (`entities.py:495-690`)
- ✅ Hitbox-based collision detection (`entities.py:813-825`)
- ✅ Sight range mechanics (`entities.py:193-198,528-533`)
- ✅ Multiple troop spawning system (generic deployment mechanism)

## Missing Features
- ❌ No specific ThreeMusketeers class or implementation found
- ❌ Triple spawn mechanics with 100ms delay not implemented
- ❌ MusketeerProjectile not implemented as a separate projectile type
- ❌ No unique Three Musketeers mechanics or abilities
- ❌ Not explicitly registered in any spell/troop registry
- ❌ Triangle formation spawning not implemented

## Notes
- The Three Musketeers appears to rely entirely on the generic `Troop` class implementation
- The card data exists in gamedata.json but no specific Three Musketeers implementation was found in the codebase
- The generic projectile system in `entities.py` should handle Musketeer's ranged attacks
- Three Musketeers' mechanics are straightforward (three Musketeers with ranged attacks) and well-covered by the base troop system
- No special gimmicks or unique abilities detected in gamedata.json that would require custom implementation
- The card is essentially a multiple troop deployment spell that spawns three regular Musketeers
