# Rage Card Implementation Audit

## Card Details
- **Card**: Rage
- **Elixir**: 2
- **Category**: Spell
- **Rarity**: Epic

## Official Mechanics (Source: Clash Royale Wiki)
- 2 Elixir cost
- 3-tile radius area of effect
- 4.5 second duration
- 35% speed boost to allied troops and buildings
- 35% attack speed boost to allied troops and buildings

## Gamedata.json Analysis
**Key mechanics from gamedata.json:**
- `manaCost`: 2
- `radius`: 3000 (units)
- `deathAreaEffectData.lifeDuration`: 5500ms (5.5s)
- `buffData.hitSpeedMultiplier`: 135 (35% increase)
- `buffData.speedMultiplier`: 135 (35% increase)
- `buffData.spawnSpeedMultiplier`: 135 (35% increase)
- `hitsGround`: true
- `hitsAir`: true

## Implemented
- ✅ Basic spell definition in `spells.py:454` as `BuffSpell`
- ✅ Elixir cost (2)
- ✅ Area effect radius (3000.0 units)
- ✅ Speed multiplier (1.5 = 50% boost)
- ✅ Damage multiplier (1.4 = 40% attack speed boost)
- ✅ Buff duration (6.0 seconds)

## Missing
- ❌ **Incorrect buff duration**: 6.0s in code vs 5.5s in gamedata
- ❌ **Incorrect speed multiplier**: 50% in code vs 35% in gamedata
- ❌ **Incorrect damage multiplier**: 40% in code vs 35% in gamedata
- ❌ **Missing spawn speed multiplier**: Not implemented but present in gamedata
- ❌ **No actual buff application logic**: No code found to apply speed/damage multipliers to entities

## Notes
- **Name mapping**: Card is correctly named "Rage" in all files
- **Assumptions**: Code assumes `BuffSpell` class exists and handles buff application, but no buff application logic found in entities.py
- **Critical gap**: While the spell is defined, there's no implementation of how buffs are actually applied to troops/buildings
- **Value discrepancies**: All multiplier values and duration differ between code and gamedata.json
- **Implementation status**: Spell is registered but functional implementation appears incomplete
