# Golden Knight Implementation Audit

## Card Overview
- **Card**: Golden Knight
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop (Champion)
- **Rarity**: Champion
- **Type**: Ground troop

## Implemented
- Basic troop movement and pathfinding (`src/clasher/entities.py:240-690`)
- Ground targeting (`src/clasher/entities.py:159-214`)
- Basic attack mechanics (`src/clasher/entities.py:292-308`)
- Health and damage systems (`src/clasher/entities.py:66-70`)
- Status effect handling (stun, slow) (`src/clasher/entities.py:108-135`)
- Card data loading structure (`src/clasher/data.py:102-303`)

## Missing
- **Dash/Charge Mechanics**: Card has `dashDamage: 131`, `dashCount: 10`, `dashSecondaryRange: 5500`, `jumpSpeed: 400` - no implementation found
- **Chain Attack Ability**: Card has ability `GoldenKnightChain` with `manaCost: 1`, `cooldown: 8000`, `dashRange: 5500` - no implementation found
- **Specific Golden Knight class**: No dedicated `GoldenKnight` class exists in the codebase
- **Champion card handling**: No specific champion mechanics implemented
- **Ability system**: No champion ability activation system exists

## Notes
- The gamedata.json shows Golden Knight as a Champion card with complex dash and chain attack mechanics
- Current implementation would only handle Golden Knight as a basic ground troop through the generic `Troop` class
- The card's unique dash mechanics (10 dashes with specific damage and range) are not implemented
- The chain attack ability (8-second cooldown, 5500 range) is not implemented
- Entity system exists but lacks champion-specific features
- Card data loader can parse the card but game logic cannot execute its unique mechanics
