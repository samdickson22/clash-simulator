# Magic Archer Implementation Audit

## Card Info
- **Card**: Magic Archer
- **Elixir**: 4
- **Category**: Troop
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Type**: Ranged troop with area damage projectiles

## Implemented
- Basic troop movement and pathfinding (entities.py:240-690)
- Projectile creation and movement (entities.py:769-825)
- Area damage/splash damage system (entities.py:72-106, 803-825)
- Air/ground targeting (entities.py:174-176, 188-191)
- Hitbox-based collision detection (entities.py:813-825)
- Status effects system (stun, slow) (entities.py:108-135)

## Missing
- **Piercing Projectiles**: Magic Archer's arrows should pierce through multiple targets in a line, dealing damage to all enemies they pass through. Current projectiles only deal splash damage at impact point.
- **Extended Projectile Range**: Magic Archer has a projectile range of 11000 (11 tiles) vs standard range of 7000 (7 tiles), but this is not specifically implemented.
- **Projectile Speed**: Magic Archer arrows travel at 1000 speed units, but no specific projectile speed implementation was found.
- **Area Damage Radius**: Magic Archer has a 250-unit radius for area damage, but this isn't specifically mapped to the card implementation.

## Notes
- **Name Mapping**: The card is named "EliteArcher" in gamedata.json but displays as "Magic Archer" in the englishName field
- **Gamedata Reference**: gamedata.json shows Magic Archer (EliteArcher) with:
  - 4 elixir cost, Legendary rarity
  - 207 HP, 52 damage, 60 speed
  - 7000 range, 7500 sight range, 1100 hit speed
  - Projectile: EliteArcherArrow with 1000 speed, 250 radius, 11000 range
  - Targets: air and ground
- **Architecture**: Uses generic projectile system but lacks specific piercing behavior that distinguishes Magic Archer from other area damage troops
- **Evolution Ignored**: Super Magic Archer evolution data was excluded per requirements
